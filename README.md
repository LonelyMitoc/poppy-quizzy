# **poppy-quizzy**

## **Description**
A browser quiz on Javascript using minimal HTML and more DOM to change the shown pages.
This was probably the most struggle I had in a project because of punctuation (missing brackets and quotation, etc. breaking the code). The step-by-step process was easy to map out and it was just finding the correct code to execute the procedure.
 ## **Features**
 - The page will open with a short description and two buttons to click; High Score and Start.
 - Timer and questions will render once the start button is pressed with high score button being disabled until the quiz is over.
 - After each question, there will be a message stating if your answer was correct or not.
 - The quiz will end when all questions are answered or the time hits 0.
 - The high score and sumbit button will not proceed if the initials input is empty
 - The high score page will display the 10 best score or the scores that are saved locally if it is less than 10 scores.
 - There will be two buttons accessible in the high score page; Restart Quiz and Clear High Scores.
